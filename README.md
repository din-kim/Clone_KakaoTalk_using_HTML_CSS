### WHAT I'VE LEARNED

I started programming with Python and I thought it was an wise choice
because I was able to understand the structure of programming language from the beginnning. (Now that I think about it, it was very superficial)
After, I did some machine learning projects using Python and its wonderful libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and tensorflow.
One parameter, one line of codes lends me superpower to analyze and predict this world.
Suddenly, I felt like I am a great coder and I thought I could solve all the problems in the world with this power.

It wasn't until a long time later that I realized that it is not. (It hasn't been long.)
Just because you can use a tool doesn't mean you really understand it.
Watch the latest IT YouTubers.
They are not just people who make good use of iPhones.
They are people who explain all the goods and bads to audience by opening the hood under the screen and showing how its chip and camera looks like.

In fact, I've recently created a terrible Ionic app as a side project.
I wrote down hundreds of wasting codes that were so messy, inconsistent, unintepretable that I couldn't even understand after a few days.
The result turned out to be a failure, of course. And I've run out of confidence.
"What programming do I want to do? What is the development?" This thought has been dominating my brain lately.

Fortunately, HTML and CSS hinted me of what programming is while taking HTML and CSS course from Nomad Code.
In this course, I have learned the importance of

- naming a class name that could be understood by anyone,
- creating a component if you want to use same code without repeatition,
- playing with tiny details having potentials to bring huge impact on the performance.

I believe this learnings happen to apply everywhere in the programming world.
There was a huge difference between doing and doing with understanding.
I now know how to enjoy writing some code.

The failure will repeat itself and frustration will often make me kneel.
But I won't give up because programmer's soul and spirit keep growing in my mind.
My very next step, JavaScript.
Can't wait. I'm looking forward to it.
I'll be right back!
